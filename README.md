## 🔧 Kaufland support

Kaufland support is intentionally implemented as a small adapter in Grocery Deals rather than duplicating Kaufland's offer-fetching logic. The `ha-kaufland` integration already provides its weekly offers through its coordinator; Grocery Deals now registers the `kaufland` domain, consumes its `discounts` data alongside the existing supermarket schemas, and recognizes Kaufland's `date_to` validity field. This keeps Kaufland data sourced from the dedicated `ha-kaufland` integration while allowing Grocery Deals to aggregate it with the other providers.

## ✨ Features

- **🔍 Custom Keyword Filtering**:
  - Configure any list of search terms (e.g. `Monster Energy`, `Butter`, `Kaffee`, `Gurke`).
  - For each keyword, a dedicated sensor is generated:
    - **State**: Current best price & store (e.g., `0,88 € (Lidl)`) or `Nicht im Angebot`.
    - **Attributes**:
      - `on_sale`: `True` / `False`
      - `best_price`: Lowest price found across all markets
      - `best_store`: Name of the market offering the best price
      - `on_sale_stores`: List of all markets where the item is currently on sale
      - `all_prices`: Complete price breakdown grouped by supermarket
      - `offers`: All matching offer details with images, validity dates, base prices, and pack sizes.
- **🚀 Dynamic Auto-Discovery**:
  - Automatically discovers when 2 or more supermarket integrations are set up on your Home Assistant.
  - Zero-touch prompt to enable the aggregator hub.
- **📊 Hub Overview Sensor**:
  - Shows the total count of active deals across all your keywords and lists which stores are connected.
- **⚡ Zero Additional API Load**:
  - Seamlessly re-uses the cached coordinator data from your installed supermarket integrations without spamming external supermarket APIs.
